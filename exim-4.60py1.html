<h2>What is 'Exim-Python'?</h2>


<div class="section">

    <h3>Exim</h3>

    <p>
    Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of
    Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. There is a
    great deal of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are
    extensive facilities for checking incoming mail.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="http://www.exim.org/">http://www.exim.org/</a>
    </p>


    <h3>Python</h3>

    <p>
    Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
    language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python
    combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes,
    exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There
    are interfaces to many system calls and libraries.
    </p>

    </p>


    <h3>Exim-Python</h3>

    <p>
    Exim-Python is the name for an extension to Exim which adds the ability to
    execute compiled Python functions and methods from within Exim
    configuration file string expansions. Since Exim uses string expansions
    heavily throughout it's operation, this feature allows powerful added
    control to an already very flexible mail server.
    </p>

    </p>

</div>




<a name="why"></a>
<h2>Why might I need the extension?</h2>

<div class="section">
    <p>
    Exim alone is an extremely powerful mail server, approaching as feature
    complete as one can expect from any mail server software. It is also fairly
    easy to extend Exim using native code, but to experiment with new feature
    implementation like this takes a lot of time.
    </p>

    <p>
    This extension allows you to prototype a new feature for Exim quickly and
    easily. To say it is useful only as a prototyping tool would be incorrect,
    indeed the performance of the extension and the code running beneath it
    should suffice for all but the highest volume mail servers.
    </p>

    <p>
    Other potential uses of the extension include data source abstraction, for
    example, using the Python DB-API, you can make your Exim installation
    database-independant by calling a layer of functions that perform lookups
    using DB-API compatible interfaces rather than directly themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you have questions regarding the usage or behaviour of this extension,
    please contact the author at the address at the top of this document.
    </p>
</div>


<a name="install"></a>
<h2>How do I install the extension?</h2>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    <p>
    You must be using a version of Python that supports the <em>boolean
    protocol</em>. This means that a minimum version of <strong>Python
    2.2.1</strong> is required for operation of the extension.
    </p>


    <p>
    The extension is distributed in two versions - a <em>patch</em> and a
    <em>pre-patched tarball</em>. It is recommended that you use the
    pre-patched tarball unless you need to further extend Exim with other third
    party patches.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: the pre-patched tarball also includes the latest
    version of the <em>exiscan-acl</em> patch, available from
    <a href="http://duncanthrax.net/exiscan-acl/"
    >http://duncanthrax.net/exiscan-acl/</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This has little impact on the operation of Exim if you don't use it's
    features, however it is a very common requirement in modern Exim
    installations, and as such, is included for ease of installation. The
    usefulness of this extension is also greatly increased by the presence of
    the extra ACLs.
    </p>


    <h3>Manually patching the Exim distribution.</h3>

    <p>
    Download and extract the latest Exim tarball from <a
    href="http://www.exim.org/">http://www.exim.org/</a>, and the accompanying
    patch from <a href="http://botanicus.net/dw/">http://botanicus.net/dw/</a>:
    </p>

    <kbd>
    $ cd /usr/src<br />
    $ wget http://www.exim.org/ftp/exim4/exim-4.32.tar.bz2<br />
    $ wget http://botanicus.net/exim-python/exim-4.32py1.patch<br />
    $ tar jxvf exim-4.32.tar.bz2
    </kbd>

    <p>
    Enter the Exim source directory, and apply the patch:
    </p>

    <kbd>
    $ cd exim-4.32<br />
    $ patch -p1 &lt; ../exim-4.32py1.patch
    </kbd>


    <h3>Configuring the Exim sources.</h3>

    <p>
    Follow the Exim installation procedure outlined in the specification:
    <a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.30/doc/html/spec_4.html"
    >http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.30/doc/html/spec_4.html</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In <code>Local/Makefile</code>, you will additionally need to specify the
    <code>EXIM_PYTHON</code>, <code>PYTHON_CC</code>,
    <code>PYTHON_CCOPTS</code>, and <code>PYTHON_LIBS</code> variables. The
    defaults should suffice, although you may need to adjust the included paths
    if you have installed Python to a non-standard location.
    </p>


    <h3>Additional configuration directives.</h3>

    <p>
    In order to enable the extension, you must tell it the name of a Python
    source file to load and compile at startup. Any modules, packages,
    functions, and classes that you wish to use should be defined in this file,
    or imported into it using the Python <code>import</code> statement.
    </p>


    <h4>python_at_start</h4>

    <p>
    The boolean <code>python_at_start</code> parameter indicates to Exim
    whether or not it should load the extension at startup. It defaults to
    <code>false</code>, to help reduce daemon memory usage slightly. Setting it
    to <code>true</code> will increase the performance of the server when
    Python calls are made later on. This is recommended for production servers.
    </p>


    <h4>python_startup</h4>

    <p>
    The string <code>python_startup</code> parameter specifies the name of the
    Python source file to load and compile at startup. This parameter must be
    set to a valid (existing, and syntactically valid) source file pathname in
    order for the extension to be used.
    </p>


    <h4>Example:</h4>

    <kbd>
    # Parse and load a Python module for use in ${python} expansions.<br />
    python_at_start = true<Br />
    python_startup = /etc/exim/exim.py
    </kbd>
</div>




<a name="usage"></a>
<h2>How do I use the extension?</h2>

<div class="section">
    <h3>How the extension loads and runs your code.</h3>


    <h4>File loading.</h4>

    <p>
    At startup, the extension will attempt to read in the contents of the file
    specified by the <code>python_startup</code> configuration parameter,
    compile it, and execute it as a module.
    </p>

    <h4>Usage of "__name__".</h4>

    <p>
    When the extension executes your code, it sets the module-level variable
    <code>__name__</code> to <code>__exim__</code>. The usage semantics of
    <code>__name__</code> are aligned with how Python uses it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    By testing <code>__name__</code>, it is possible (although impractical in
    many cases) to write a single Python source file that will operate as a
    standard Python module, an Exim-Python module, and as a command-line tool.
    Here is an example:
    </p>

    <kbd>
    if __name__ == '__main__':<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run_commandline()<br />
    <br />
    elif __name__ == '__exim__':<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; init_exim_module()<br />
    <br />
    else:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass
        # Running as a Python module, do nothing.
    </kbd>



    <h3>How Python functions and methods are called.</h3>

    <p>
    When the extension encounters a <code>${python {&lt;fn&gt;} ...}</code>
    expansion, it resolves the name <code>&lt;fn&gt;</code>. In the module
    loaded previously. <code>...</code> may be one or more string arguments
    that will be passed to the Python function, encapsulated in braces.
    </p>

    <h4>Return values and exceptions.</h4>

    <p>
    Several rules are applied to the result of your Python function, and it is
    very important you understand them. <strong>Note</strong>: it is an error
    if your Python function does not return a value!
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>If the called function returns <code>None</code> (implicit default if
        no <code>return</code> with value executed), then the expansion is
        forced to fail.</li>

    <li>If the called function generates an exception, the exception will be
        printed on <code>sys.stderr</code>, a log will be made in the paniclog,
        and the expansion will be forced to fail.</li>

    <li>If the called function returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>
        (the boolean singletons), these are converted to the strings
        <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> respectively.</li>
    </ul>




    <h3>Loading and initialising module resources.</h3>

    <p>
    Exim is a rather complex piece of software, and the execution path it takes
    can be quite confusing at times. For this reason, it is desirable to be as
    careful as possible when initialising and using resources.
    </p>


    <h4>The problem.</h4>

    <p>
    Exim forks quite regularly, and much of it's operation happens inside a
    subprocess. When Exim performs a fork, any objects existing in the Python
    interpreter at the time of fork will now be duplicated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This can lead to dangerous and incorrect use of, for example, database
    connections, which will now have essentially two clients connected to only
    one client's connection.
    </p>

    <p>
    The extension as yet does not provide any automatic means for handling
    objects that should be destroyed or reinitialised at fork time, so it is up
    to you to do this.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
    The resulting code often makes judicious use of global variables, that
    while ugly, are the best solution to the problem.
    </p> -->


    <h4>A simple solution.</h4>

    <p>
    Here, our dangerous resource is created and destroyed every time the
    function is entered. This avoids the problem in almost all cases.
    </p>

    <kbd>
    def get_db():<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; db = MySQL.connect(**mysql_connection_details)<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; return db, db.cursor()<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    def lookup_password(username):<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; db, cursor = get_db()<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; if not cursor.execute("""SELECT ..."""):<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return None # force failure.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; return cursor.fetchone()[0]
    </kbd>
</div>



<a name="notes"></a>
<h2>Things you should know before use.</h2>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>

    <p>
    Every feature of the Python environment is not available from within Exim.
    Certain limitations are placed on your code to avoid destablizing the Exim
    server process. Here they are:
    </p>


    <h4>Avoid the use of threads.</h4>

    <p>
    Or, do so at your own risk. There are many complications associated with
    the use of threads, and you can almost certainly accomplish your goal
    without using them.
    </p>


    <h4>Avoid signal manipulation.</h4>

    <p>
    At this time, it is currently unknown how Exim would deal with restarting
    system calls in the case of a signal delivery handled by the extension. It
    is recommended that you avoid all use of the <code>signal</code> module
    until usage documentation appears in a future release of this extension.
    </p>


    <h3>Other usage notes.</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>
        If your code opens any files, it is recommended that you use the
        <code>fcntl.FD_CLOEXEC</code> flag on them, in order to enhance
        security, and keep the files within their required scope.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you are seeing failed string expansions, but no further traceback
        information is being provided, you may want to reopen the
        <code>sys.stderr</code> object in your module, directed to a file in
        <code>/tmp</code>. A better solution to this is in the works.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you instantiate a class, or wish to write directly to a function or method
        or callable class deep inside a module hierarchy, you may do so. Example:

        <kbd>
        # Python code:<br />
        import sys<br />
        <br />
        # Exim expansion:<br />
        ${python {sys.stderr.write} {$sender_host_address}}
        </kbd>
    </li>
    </ul>
</div>



<a name="examples"></a>
<h2>Usage examples.</h2>


<div class="section">
    <h3>Deny connections from certain countries using GeoIP.</h3>

    <p>
    This example combines the extension with Exim's built-in access control
    lists. Here, we prevent connections to the mail server unless they
    originate a country that is specifically authorised to send e-mail to us.
    This is an effective, if dangerous, anti-spam measure for English speakers.
    </p>

    <p>
    It requires the GeoIP client library, a copy of the GeoIP database, and the
    GeoIP Python bindings. See <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/python"
    >http://www.maxmind.com/app/python</a>.
    </p>


    <h4>Python Module</h4>

    <kbd>
    import GeoIP<br />
    <br />
    gi = GeoIP.new(GeoIP.GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE)<br />
    allowed_countries = [ 'UK', 'US', 'CA', 'EU', 'IE' ]<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    def connect_denied(remote_addr)<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; if not remote_addr: # Local connection.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return False # Allow it.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; country = gi.country_code_by_addr(remote_addr)<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; return country not in allowed_countries
    </kbd>


    <h4>Exim Configuration</h4>

    <kbd>
    # My "acl_smtp_connect" ACL:<br />
    <br />
    acl_check_connect:<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; deny condition = ${python {connect_denied} {$sender_host_address}}<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp;message &nbsp; = "Your country is not allowed to connect to this server."<br />

    </ul>

</div>




<a name="future"></a>
<h2>Future considerations.</h2>


<div class="section">
    <h3>Needs fixed.</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>When running Exim in debug mode, for example, with 
        <code>exim -d -bd</code>, pressing the interrupt key will not shut Exim
        down. This is evidence that Python is still further damaging signals or
        some other behaviour, and requires investigation.</li>

    </ul>



    <h3>Needs tested.</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Verify that <code>save_signals()</code> and <code>load_signals()</code>
        in <code>python.c</code> are working effectively.</li>

    <li>Ensure that <code>PyOS_AfterFork()</code> is called only when
        necessary.</li>

    <li>Check the safety of <code>while ()</code> predicates in
        <code>python.c:python_resolve()</code>.</li>

    </ul>



    <h3>Needs implemented.</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Add memory checking to <code>python.c:call_python_cat()</code> in the
        arg tuple build.</li>

    <li>Add memory checking to <code>python.c:save_signals()</code>.

    <li>Remove the requirement for <code>#undef HAVE_SETEUID</code> in
        <code>python.c</code>. Find out if it is Exim or Python being
        ignorant.</li>

    <li>Add support for <code>${pythonkw {keywordlist} [{arg1} [{argn}
        ..]]}</code> for calling objects that can accept keyword arguments.
        keywordlist will be of the exim form <code>key=val key2=val2</code> and
        so on.</li>

    <li>Add support for converting Python dictionaries into Exim-style
        <code>key=val</code> strings on return from a function.</li>

    <li>Make Python traceback output configurable to syslog, file, standard
        error, or Exim's paniclog.</li>

    </ul>



    <h3>The wishlist.</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Add a standard way of registering objects that need reinitialised after
        a fork. Some sort of
        <code>
            (&lt;parent&gt;,
             &lt;object_name&gt;,
             &lt;constructor&gt;,
             &lt;constructor_args&gt;,
             &lt;constructor_kwargs&gt;,
             &lt;reinit_where&gt;)</code>
        6-tuple?</li>

    <li>Add support for modifying certain Exim variables at run-time, for hot
        reconfiguration, and so fourth. This would require the ability to
        safely trigger Python code at arbitrary locations in Exim. A
        mammoth task, and a potentially involved implementation.</li>

    <li>Integrate the exim-python.html documentation file into the Exim
        specification, and provide the patched documentation online as
        HTML.</li>

    <li>Make available a <code>python</code> router, transport, authenticator,
        and lookup. This might be useful to some, for example, for SQL-backed
        e-mail storage.</li>

    <li>Add a general <code>exim</code> module, to allow certain internal Exim
        functions be called from Python. This would also encapsulate the
        run-time reconfiguration wishlist item.</li>
